# Hector
Hector is a very simple discord bot meant as a learning project for the creator. This is not a discord bot that tries to
innovate in any shape or form.

## Usage
The currently available commands for Hector are:  

<b>!hello</b>  
Says Hi!

<b>!member_count</b>  
Returns the amount of members in the server the message was sent from.

<b>!remind_me <em>message time</em></b>  
Sends a private message to the person who sent the command, containing the specified message. The message is sent after a specified
amount of time has passed (Max 24 hours in the future).

<b>!birthday</b>  
Sends a birthday greeting if it's someones birthday.

## Current use


Hector is currently running on a Raspberry Pi 3b+ and is therefore not meant for widespread use. The current scope of Hectors use
is one discord server with 6 members and a private discord server with only me in it for testing purposes.

## Contributing
This project is currently private and there is no plans on making outside contributions to the project available in the near future.
